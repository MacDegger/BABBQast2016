BABBQ ChromeCast presentation demo

Demo program on how to ChromeCast information from an Android device to a ChromeCast screen. 

This demo app shows the absolute basics of how to use the CastPresentation class to show something, independant of what is on your android device's screen, on the screen a ChromeCast is connected to.

It was written for the Big Android BBQ 2015 and updated quite a bit using the latest android ChromeCast API's for the BABBQ Texas 2016.
